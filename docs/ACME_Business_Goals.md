# ACME Digital Transformation Business Goals
## Who we are
We are ACME Publishing, with over 60 years of history, currently having a portfolio of 30+ monthly and weekly papers, 5+ daily newspapers, several books (cookbocks, lifestyle), and couple of CD's, mostly thematic, anthologies, best of's, not tied to a specific artist. They sell merchandise and items related to the content. They also have a couple of portals, some of them run on the same name as prints, sometimes with diverging content, sometimes with digital republish of print materials. Over the time they decomissioned around 30 more periodicals.

## Problem statement
ACME Publishing is running or very high cost, and cannot earn as much as possible from the content they produce. We are also behind in adapting to consumer behaviours and needs, growth is slower than needed, consumers are getting old.
 
ACME has digital solutions, but has couple of portal engines running in paralell, advertisments are the only income from digital publishing. No real or delayed feedback from consumers, no visibility where to go, what they like, etc.
Where do we want to get
ACME Publishing wants to consolidate and rationalize its portfolio, increase revenue and adapt to new consumer behaviours. We will reconsider their portfolio, and we want to step on a dgitalisation path. Also, our goal is to build stronger engagement with our readers, consumers. 
 
## The solution
The digital transformation should cover the following:
OCR and digitalize everything from print. Newer releases are already in digital format, but before 1985, everything was mechanical
Create or buy a publishing software which will manage the digital golden source for all print and online periodicals, including the past
Have an online shop for phyisically available goods, merch, etc.
Have a CRM with different subscription schemas (digital, print) and webshop access
Have configurable paywall subsystem for everything digital
Editors should be able to publish selectively for print and or digital
CRM should provide input and feedback for targeting, advertising and consumer behavior analysis. 
The solution should contain timeline and costs, too.

## Misc. requirements
Solution has to include payment, should be scalable on demand/load, and digital content should be backed up or stored in ACME's digital center. Digital cost have to be reduced as much as possible.
