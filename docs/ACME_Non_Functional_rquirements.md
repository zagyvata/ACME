# ACME Digital Transformation Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. General
### 1.1. Performance
The system must perform efficiently and respond quickly to user requests, with low latency and high throughput.

### 1.2. Availability
The system must be highly available, with minimal downtime and disruptions, and a robust disaster recovery plan.

### 1.3. Reliability
The system must be reliable, with minimal errors and failures, and a fault-tolerant architecture.

### 1.4. Scalability
The system must be scalable, with the ability to handle growing amounts of data and users.

### 1.5. Security
The system must be secure, with the use of encryption, access controls, and other security measures to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access.

### 1.6. Accessibility
The system must be accessible, with support for different devices, screen sizes, and assistive technologies to ensure a positive user experience for all users.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization Requirements
### 2.1. Centralized Authentication and Authorization
The system must have a centralized authentication and authorization service that manages user credentials and access controls across all systems.

### 2.2. Single Sign-On
The authentication and authorization service must support single sign-on (SSO) to enable users to log in once and access multiple systems without the need to re-enter their credentials.

### 2.3. Role-Based Access Control
The authentication and authorization service must support role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users only have access to the systems and features that are relevant to their roles and responsibilities.

### 2.4. Multi-Factor Authentication
The authentication and authorization service must support multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an additional layer of security for sensitive systems and data.

### 2.5. Password Policies
The authentication and authorization service must enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password changes, to prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. Constraints
### 3.1. Budget
The project must be completed within the allocated budget, with cost optimization strategies used where possible.

### 3.2. Timeframe
The project must be completed within the agreed-upon timeframe, with a phased implementation plan used to ensure timely delivery of functionality.

### 3.3. Integration with Existing Systems
The new system must integrate seamlessly with existing systems and processes, with minimal disruption to operations.

### 3.4. Legacy Data Migration
The legacy data must be migrated to the new system with minimal data loss or corruption, and data mapping and validation performed as necessary.

Deployment Requirements
### 3.5. Deployment Automation
The deployment process must be automated using a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure consistency and reliability.

### 3.6. Rollback and Recovery
The system must include rollback and recovery mechanisms to allow for quick restoration in case of failures or errors.

### 3.7. Compliance with Regulations and Standards
The system must comply with relevant regulations and standards, including data privacy, security, and accessibility regulations.

### 3.8. Integration with Existing Systems
The project depends on the successful integration of the new system with existing systems and processes, including the Publishing Service and the e-commerce platform.

### 3.9. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
The system must be well-documented, with clear and concise documentation available to enable knowledge transfer and ongoing maintenance.

## 4. Cloud and on-prem considerations
### 4.1 Cloud
Publishing software: Hosting the publishing software in the cloud will enable easy access for editors and staff members, promote collaboration, and ensure seamless updates and maintenance.
E-commerce platform: Hosting the online shop in the cloud will provide scalability, ensuring it can handle traffic surges and accommodate growth in demand.
CRM and subscription management system: Cloud hosting will allow for easier integration with other digital services, improved scalability, and more straightforward maintenance and updates.
Paywall subsystem: Hosting the paywall in the cloud will ensure scalability and the ability to handle peak traffic loads without compromising performance.
Data analysis tools: Cloud-based data analysis tools will enable real-time insights, easy collaboration, and secure access to data for authorized personnel.

### 4.2 On-premises:
Digitized content storage: Storing a backup of digitized content in ACME's data center will provide an additional layer of data security and redundancy.
Sensitive customer data: Depending on compliance and regulatory requirements, some sensitive customer information may need to be stored on-premises to ensure data privacy and security.
Intellectual property and trade secrets: Confidential information, such as unpublished works or proprietary business processes, should be stored on-premises for added security.

### 4.3 Hybrid:
Infrastructure and content delivery: A hybrid approach can be used for hosting and delivering digital content. The primary infrastructure can be cloud-based for scalability and performance, while a backup and storage system can be maintained on-premises for redundancy and security.
